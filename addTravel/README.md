Example of implementing form components backed by [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form), extracted from an application which uses [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) for layout and [react-widgets](https://github.com/jquense/react-widgets)' date picker, where all the forms redux-form is being used to manage happen to have 2 column layouts.

Live version: http://insin.github.io/redux-form-example/

To run the example with hot reloading via [react-heatpack](https://github.com/insin/react-heatpack):

```
git clone git@gist.github.com:bbf116e8ea10ef38447b.git redux-form-example
cd redux-form-example
npm install
npm start
```
